Minecraft Python PI
===================

Modified version of Minecraft Python API with support for getBlocks (for many blocks) introduced in my fork of RaspberryJuice:

https://github.com/cjdell/RaspberryJuice

This allows for querying of vast amounts of block data and is many orders of magnitude faster than individual calls to getBlock.
